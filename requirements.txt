Libraries Used and Their Purpose:-


Streamlit:-
Description: A Python framework for building interactive web applications with minimal code.
Purpose: Used to create a user-friendly web interface where users can input prompts, adjust generation parameters, and view the generated text from the GPT-2 model.
Installation:      "pip install streamlit"


PyTorch (torch):-
Description: An open-source machine learning framework for building and running deep learning models.
Purpose: Provides the backend for loading and running the fine-tuned GPT-2 model, handling tensor operations, and managing device placement (CPU/GPU).
Installation:      "pip install torch"


Transformers (Hugging Face):-
Description: A library providing pre-trained models and tools for natural language processing tasks.
Purpose: Used to load the fine-tuned GPT-2 model (GPT2LMHeadModel) and tokenizer (GPT2Tokenizer) for text generation.
Installation:      "pip install transformers"


Logging:-
Description: A standard Python library for logging messages and debugging information.
Purpose: Used to log debugging information (e.g., model loading, text generation status) to track app performance and diagnose issues.
Installation:
No installation required, as logging is included in Python’s standard library.


Pyngrok:-
Description: A Python wrapper for ngrok, a tool that creates secure public URLs for local web servers.
Purpose: Used to expose the Streamlit app (running locally on port 8501) to a public URL, making it accessible online for testing or sharing.
Installation:         "pip install pyngrok"


Why These Libraries Were Chosen:-

Streamlit: Simplifies web app development, providing an intuitive interface for users to input prompts and view generated text.
PyTorch: Offers efficient handling of deep learning models like GPT-2, with support for GPU acceleration for faster inference.
Transformers: Provides easy access to the fine-tuned GPT-2 model and tokenizer, streamlining text generation tasks.
Logging: Enables debugging and monitoring of the app’s operations, ensuring reliability during model loading and text generation.
Pyngrok: Facilitates sharing the local Streamlit app via a public URL, ideal for testing or demo purposes.


Installation Steps:-
To set up the environment for the AI Text Generator App, run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install streamlit
pip install torch
pip install transformers
pip install pyngrok

Note: Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher recommended). The logging library is part of Python’s standard library and requires no additional installation. 
For PyTorch, you may need to install a specific version compatible with your system (e.g., CPU or GPU support); 
check PyTorch’s official website for details. The fine-tuned GPT-2 model and tokenizer must be available at the specified model_path (e.g., /content/drive/MyDrive/Generative-Text-Model/fine_tuned_model). 
An ngrok authentication token is required for pyngrok; obtain it from ngrok.com. 
Ensure app.py exists in the specified directory before running the app.

These libraries and installation steps enable the creation, deployment, and accessibility of a functional AI text generation web app using a fine-tuned GPT-2 model.
